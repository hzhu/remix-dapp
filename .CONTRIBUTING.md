# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Before you submit a pull request, we kindly ask you to review this guide thoroughly.

## Development

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and clone the repository onto your local machine. Once you have your local copy of the repository, you can commence with development. This typically involves installing the required dependencies and executing the tests.

### Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to its root directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Every [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) dApp using WalletConnect now requires a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud. This is completely free and [only takes a few minutes](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation#configure).

After obtaining a projectId from WalletConnect, include it in a .env file in the root directory. Refer to the `.env.example` file as a starting point.

## Pull Requests

When you have made your changes and verified they work correctly, you can submit a [pull request from your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Before proposing changes, please open an [issue](https://github.com/hzhu/remix-dapp/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/hzhu/remix-dapp/discussions/new/choose) for collaborative decision-making on solutions prior to submitting a pull request. This enhances the effectiveness of your contributions and promotes collective input.

### Workflow

1. **Open an [issue](https://github.com/hzhu/remix-dapp/issues/new)**: Start by opening an issue detailing the problem you want to solve or the feature you want to add.
1. **Fork and branch:** Fork the repository and create a new branch on your fork to work on the changes.
1. **Add commits:** Add new commits to your branch. Remember:
   1. Commits should be [concise, descriptive, and well formatted](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
   1. Commits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification and use the [standard headings](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/cb0f936e598c5bfb8d3e0a9c0eeb57ae59a35140/src/changelog-notes.ts#L43-L54).
   1. This repository maintains a linear git history, so merge commits are not allowed.
1. **Open a pull request:** Open a [new pull request](https://github.com/hzhu/remix-dapp/compare) on GitHub, and [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) it to the issue you created in the first step.

### Dependabot

This repository employs [Dependabot ðŸ¤–](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to [secure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates) and [update](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates#about-version-updates-for-dependencies) project dependencies by automatically initiating pull requests for package upgrades. The duty of project maintainers is to review, test, approve, and merge these Dependabot-generated pull requests.
